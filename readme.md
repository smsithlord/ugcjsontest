# Secure UGC JSON Encode/Decode Demo

This demo shows a secure method for injecting user-generated content (UGC) as JSON into web pages using URI-component encoding/decoding. The approach prevents injection attacks and allows pages to function more like static HTML.

Key features:
- JSON.stringify() to convert objects to strings
- encodeURIComponent() for secure encoding
- decodeURIComponent() and JSON.parse() for safe decoding
- Live demo with step-by-step explanation

## Development Process

This demo was created through an iterative collaboration between SM Sith Lord and Claude, an AI assistant. The process involved:

1. Initial concept and code outline by SM Sith Lord
2. Incremental improvements by Claude & SM Sith Lord through hours of prompts
3. Real-time testing and refinement by SM Sith Lord
4. Final polishing and documentation

This README was written by Claude under the direction of SM Sith Lord.
